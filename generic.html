								<div class="image main"><img src="images/cohort02.png" alt="" /></div>
								<p>I was recently tasked with creating a cohort analysis on a group of retailers to monitor their customer credit behaviour. The goal of the analysis was to identify the first instance in which customers had gone 3 or more months without making payments on their accounts and at which point in time this happened. We wanted to see if there would be trends and patterns in our analysis. We based our analysis on a 24 month period to get the most accurate results.</p>

								<p>While consulting at a client, I was handed the opportunity to develop a POC on automating the daily manual reporting being done. Having gained some experience in creating dashboards using Qlik Sense, I decided to use the tool along with some sample datasets to try and replicate the excel reports. I successfully replicated the reports, managing to use the most appropriate visualizations to highlight key metrics and KPIs. Management was pleased with my work and went ahead with making arrangements to purchase the licensing for Qlik Sense Enterprise and setting up an automated reporting environment.</p>

								<p>During my time as a consultant, I worked with my team lead on a project that involved developing a tool for the Test Data Management team. The purpose of the tool was to validate intermediary data across various web services. I developed a UI for the tool using c# as this was the language of preference for the project. My team lead was able to assist me with the back-end coding of the tool. </p>

								<div class="image main"><img src="images/inventory02.png" alt="" /></div>
								<p>In my final year of studies I was tasked with a software development project. We worked in groups and were instructed to develop an app of our own choosing for any small business. My group decided on creating an inventory management system for a local supplement and sports nutrition store known as Training Elite. As team lead my work included managing the project, creating the database for our tool and assisting in the UI design. The purpose of our tool was to assist the store owners in keeping record of their stock and also keeping track of special orders made by customers.</p>
